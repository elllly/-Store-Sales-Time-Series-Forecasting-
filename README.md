## Store Sales – Time Series Forecasting

Overview:
---------
This repository encompasses the code and documentation for my participation in the Kaggle competition: Store Sales – Time Series Forecasting. The objective of the competition was to develop a model for forecasting store sales based on various factors such as holidays, oil prices, transactions, and store information.

Key Features:
--------------
- Data Integration: Merged diverse data frames incorporating holidays, oil prices, transactions, and store information into the training data based on date and store number, enhancing the model's understanding of the complex relationships in the time series data.

- Decision Tree Regressor Model: Developed a Decision Tree Regressor model for time series forecasting, leveraging its ability to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model performance through tuning parameters such as max depth and min samples split, ensuring the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

- Model Assessment: Assessed the model accuracy using the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) with a result of 1.27597.

Dependencies:
--------------
- Python 3.10
- Scikit-learn
